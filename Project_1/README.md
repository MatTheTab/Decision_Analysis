# Project 1

Implementation of PROMETHEE I, PROMETHEE II, SRF and ELECTRE TRI-B methods

### 3.1. Data set questions:

1. What is the domain of the problem about?

A: Evaluation of video game purchase

2. What is the source of the data?

A: SteamDB https://steamdb.info/sales/

3. What is the point of view of the decision maker?

A: 

4. What is the number of alternatives considered? Were there more of them in the original data set?

A: 

5. Describe one of the alternatives considered (give its name, evaluations, specify preferences for this
alternative)

A: 

6. What is the number of criteria considered? Were there more of them in the original data set?

A: 

7. What is the origin of the various criteria? (catalog parameter / created by the decision maker - how?)

A: 

8. What are the domains of the individual criteria (discrete / continuous)? Note: in the case of continuous domains, specify the range of the criterion’s variability, in the case of others: list the values. What is the nature (gain / cost) of the individual criteria?

A: 

9. Are all criteria of equal importance (should they have the same ”weights”)? If not, can the relative
importance of the criteria under consideration be expressed in terms of weights? In this case, estimate
the weights of each criterion on a scale of 1 to 10. Are there any criteria among the criteria that are
completely or almost invalid / irrelevant?

A: 

10. Are there dominated alternatives among the considered data set? If so, present all of them (dominating and dominated alternative), giving their names and values on the individual criteria.

A: 

11. What should the theoretically best alternative look like in your opinion? Is it a small advantage on
many criteria, or rather a strong advantage on few (but key) criteria? Which?

A: 

12. Which of the considered alternatives (provide name and values on individual criteria) seems to be the best / definitely better than the others? Is it determined by one reason (e.g. definitely the lowest
price) or rather the overall value of the criteria? Does this alternative still have any weaknesses?

A: 

13. Which of the considered alternatives (provide name and values on individual criteria) seems to be the worst / definitely worse than the others? Is it determined by one reason (e.g. definitely the highest price), or rather the overall value of the criteria? Does this alternative still have any strengths?

A: 

### 3.2. Problem analysis with the use of PROMETHEE I and II

1. Write the preferential information you provided at the input of the method.

A:

2. Enter the final result obtained with the method. Usually, the first result is not the final one, you can slightly adjust the parameter values to your preferences.

A:

3. Compare the complete and partial ranking.

A:

4. Comment on the compliance of the results with your expectations and preferences. Refer, among others, to to the results for the alternatives that you indicated as the best and worst during the data
analysis. What operations were required to obtain the final result (e.g. changing the ranking of criteria, adding blank cards, changing the value of threshold)?

A:

### 3.3. Problem analysis with the use of ELECTRE TRI-B

1. Write the preferential information you provided at the input of the method.

A:

2. Enter the final result obtained with the method. Usually, the first result is not the final one, you can slightly adjust the parameter values to your preferences.

A:

3. Comment on the compliance of the results with your expectations and preferences. Refer, among
others, to to the results for the alternatives that you indicated as the best and worst during the data
analysis. What operations were required to obtain the final result (e.g. changing the ranking of criteria, adding blank cards, changing the value of threshold)?

A:

4. Compare the optimistic and pessimistic class assignments.

A:

5. Comment on the compliance of the results with your expectations and preferences. Refer, among
others, to to the results for the alternatives that you indicated as the best and worst during the data
analysis. What operations were required to obtain the final result (e.g. changing the ranking of criteria, adding blank cards, changing the value of threshold, boundaries or the λ parameter)?

A:

### 3.4. Compare method results
